agora vai tocar a musica Civil War da banda, Guns N' Roses.

And the wars go on with brainwashed pride
For the love of God and our human rights

And all these things are swept aside
By bloody hands, time can't deny
And are washed away by your genocide
And history hides the lies of our civil wars

Did you wear a black armband
When they shot the man
Who said peace could last forever?

And in my first memories
They shot Kennedy
I went numb when I learned to see

So I never fell for Vietnam
We got the wall of D.C. to remind us all
That you can't trust freedom
When it's not in your hands
When everybody's fighting
For their promised land
